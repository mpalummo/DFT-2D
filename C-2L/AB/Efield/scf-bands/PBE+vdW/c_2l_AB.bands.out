     Parallel version (MPI & OpenMP), running on       8 processor cores
     Number of MPI processes:                 8
     Threads/MPI process:                     1

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4
     Presently no symmetry can be used with electric field
