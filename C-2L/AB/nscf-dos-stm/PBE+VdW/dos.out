     Parallel version (MPI & OpenMP), running on       8 processor cores
     Number of MPI processes:                 8
     Threads/MPI process:                     1

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =       8
     0 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts


     Reading xml data from directory:
